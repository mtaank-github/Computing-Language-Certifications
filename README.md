# Learning New Computing Languages
### Mukesh Taank

I am always keen to learn new programming languages and different programs and applications. One of my career interests is in Data Science, so I want to learn some useful languages and programs specifically for this field. I feel as though I am lacking in some of the programming language requirements for some Data Science positions, so this is my way of showing that I have learned these new languages and gain practical experience using them.

I have taken some courses from Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/). This website has provided some exceptional content for me to learn from, and allowed me to gain some practical experience utilizing each language/program to complete exercises. 

In this repository, I will be showcasing my work following the lectures from the Udemy courses (which will be linked in each folder). I want to present the new languages/programs I have studied, attach some lecture notes and code (where appropriate), and finally provide the certificate of completion for the course.
