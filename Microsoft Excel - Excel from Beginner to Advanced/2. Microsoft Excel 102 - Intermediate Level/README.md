# Microsoft Excel 102 - Intermediate Level

In this part of the course, we mainly looked at the fundamentals of Excel and its interface.

We utilized a base workbook (see file titled: "Excel102Exercises.xlsx"). This workbook contained numerous worksheets that contained:
  - Sales Data
  - Employee Records
  - Customer Information
  - Order Information
  - Hiring Information
  - Multiple lists with currency values
  
All of this was provided by the Udemy course. 

As I went through the lectures, this workbook was updated following along with the instructor. All of the updates were done by me.

Going through the lectures, some of the main skills I picked up included:
  - Working with Excel Lists
  - Using List Functions, including Database functions like DSUM(), DAVERAGE(), DCOUNT(), and SUBTOTAL()
  - Data Validation
  - Importing Data (from Text files and from Microsoft Access Databases) and Exporting Data (as Text Files or CSV files)
  - Generating PivotTables and using Microsoft Excel's PowerPivot Tool to better present the data from lists.
  - Working with very large datasets (1000+ records)
  
This part of the course really covered some more involved areas of Excel. It was beneficial to be able to do the work myself on my own spreadsheet to get some working experience with these different types of datasets.

In the next part of the course (103), we start looking at more advanced level content.
