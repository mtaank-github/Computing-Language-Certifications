# Microsoft Excel 103 - Advanced Level

In this part of the course, we mainly looked at the more advanced functions and areas of Excel and its interface.

We utilized a base workbook (see file titled: "Excel103Exercises.xlsx"). This workbook contained numerous worksheets that contained:
  - Sales Data
  - Employee Records
  - Customer Information
  - Order Information
  - Hiring Information
  - Multiple lists with currency values

All of this was provided by the Udemy course.

As I went through the lectures, this workbook was updated following along with the instructor. All of the updates were done by me.

Going through the lectures, some of the main skills I picked up included:
  - Cell References vs Name Ranges
  - Using Excel's conditional functions including **IF()**, **AND()**, **COUNTIF()**, **SUMIF()** and **IFERROR()**
  - Working with Excel Lookup functions including **VLOOKUP()**, **HLOOKUP()**, **INDEX()** and **MATCH()**
  - Nesting Excel Functions
  - Text-based functions including **LEFT()**, **RIGHT()**, **MID()**, **SEARCH()**, **CONCATENATE()** and **LEN()**
  - Auditing an Excel Worksheet
  - How to Protect an Excel Worksheets and Workbooks.
  
This part of the course really covered some more involved areas of Excel. It was beneficial to be able to do the work myself on my own spreadsheet to get some working experience with these different types of datasets.

In the next part of the course (Macros and VBAs), we start looking at even more advanced level content within Excel.
