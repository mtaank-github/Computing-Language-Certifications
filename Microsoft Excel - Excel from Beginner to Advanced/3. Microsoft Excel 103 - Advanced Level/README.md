# Microsoft Excel 103 - Advanced Level

In this part of the course, we mainly looked at the more advanced functions and areas of Excel and its interface.

We utilized a base workbook (see file titled: "Excel103Exercises.xlsx"). This workbook contained numerous worksheets that contained:
  - Sales Data
  - Employee Records
  - Customer Information
  - Order Information
  - Hiring Information
  - Multiple lists with currency values
All of this was provided by the Udemy course.

As I went through the lectures, this workbook was updated following along with the instructor. All of the updates were done by me.

Going through the lectures, some of the main skills I picked up included:
  - Cell References vs Name Ranges
  - Using Excel's conditional functions including IF(), AND(), COUNTIF(), SUMIF() and IFERROR()
  - Working with Excel Lookup functions including VLOOKUP(), HLOOKUP(), INDEX() and MATCH()
  - Text-based functions including LEFT(), RIGHT(), MID(), SEARCH(), CONCATENATE() and LEN()
  - Auditing an Excel Worksheet
  - How to Protect an Excel Worksheets and Workbooks.

In the next part of the course (Macros and VBAs), we start looking at even more advanced level content within Excel.
