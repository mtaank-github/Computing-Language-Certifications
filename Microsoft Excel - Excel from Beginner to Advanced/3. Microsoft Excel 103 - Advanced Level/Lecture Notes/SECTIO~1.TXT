Automating Repetitive Tasks in Excel with Macros

Lecture 154: Understanding Excel Macros
-We are looking at the sheet titled: "Macro".
-Motivation: Lets say we have a table of data. We have raw data, not much to it. We want to sort it, filter it, make it into a PivotTable, whatever. What if you are going to be working with this type of data regularly? You want it always formatted with headers, correct value types, etc.
-We can do this manually, but if you are doing this a lot, we can set up a macro.
-A macro allows you to do all this. You record yourself doing the task once, then next time, you click a button and it does the same thing it recorded. The work is done.

Lecture 155: Activating the Developer Tab in Excel
-Go to file, options, then Click on ""
-Go to any tab in the ribbon and rightclick one of them, then click "Customize the Ribbon". You can see all of the Ribbon tabs. If we check "Developer", it will now show up.

Lecture 156: Creating a Macro with the Macro Recorder
-Well start with the easiest macro, the recorder. Lets record ourselves cleaning up this data.
-In the developer tab, click on "Record Macro". 
-Well name it and give it a shortcut key and a description. Once you click OK, Excel starts recording everything you do. 
-Well format the table as necessary, then well click "Stop Recording", which is also in the "Code" Section of the Developer tab.

Lecture 157: Editing a Macro with VBA
-Now we will see how to edit a macro. Lets say we made a typo, or we want to change the formatting.
-Go to Developer Tab and in the Code section click on "Visual Basic". This opens up the Visual Basic Editor. All the code that Excel recorded is in Visual Basic.
-This opens up a completely different window. On the left side, we see all the sheets in the workbook. When you record a macro, all the code is stored in a "Module". We can click on this folder and we can see all the code Excel generated while I recorded the steps.
-We can sort of point out some of our steps. We can edit here and fix typos if needed. We can also reorder some of our steps by moving around some of the code.

Lecture 158: Creating Buttons to Run Macros
-We are now in the sheet titled: "Test Macro".
-We have recorded and edited the macro, now lets use it. 
-In the developer tab, in the "Controls" section click on the button "Insert". The very first button in this drop down is a command button. We can make a box with this and it will open a window to make a macro button. We can rename it. 
-We now have a hovering button. Click this button and it performs the macro. The table is now formatted with the click of one button.
