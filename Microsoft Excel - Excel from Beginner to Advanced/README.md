This directory with highlight my work from the Excel course from Udemy. This course is constantly updated, and was completed by me in 2023 using the latest versions of Microsoft Excel.

This course is split into four parts:
  1. Microsoft Excel 101
  2. Microsoft Excel 102
  3. Microsoft Excel 103
  4. Master Microsoft Excel Macros and VBA in 7 Simple Projects
 
I have created subdirectories for each of these which contain a README.md file wherein I describe what is covered in each subdirectory. In these subdirectories, I share my lecture notes from following along the video lectures and supply my excel workbooks (.xlsx) wherein I use what was learned in lecture in a practical setting.
