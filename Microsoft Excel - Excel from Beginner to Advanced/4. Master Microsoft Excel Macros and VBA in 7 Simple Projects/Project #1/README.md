# Project #1 - Using Excel's Macro Recorder Tool

In this project, we are given a list of raw data. It contains no headers and no formatting of any kind. 

We want to be able to format this data and make it look nice, give it headers, change the values from general numbers to currency, etc.

We want to do this, but it is a bit tedious to do this all the time. Let's say we are going to be recieving Weekly data of this form. So every week, we will have to format it accordingly. This is very manual. We would have to re-format it every week. And there is no guarentee we will be able to format it identically each time.

This is where the Macro Recorder Tool is very powerful. We can record ourselves formatting this set of data one time. This way, by the time next week comes around and we recieve our weekly data list, we can click one button and it will automatically format it for us the exact way we did last time.
