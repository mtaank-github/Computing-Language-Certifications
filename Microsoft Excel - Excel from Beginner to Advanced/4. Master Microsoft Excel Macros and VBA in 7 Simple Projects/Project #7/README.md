# Project #7 - Importing Data from Text Files

In this project, we are working with a blank excel document. This project deals with importing data from text files.

Sometimes, data comes to us not as an Excel file, but as a text file. In cases where we need to import multiple text files, it takes a long time to do these one by one. 
We can set up a macro to import all of these for us and place each dataset in individual worksheets. 

Also, we go a little above and beyond and use Functions to add some reuseablility into our code.
