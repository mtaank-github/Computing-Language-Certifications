# Project #5 - Bringing it All Together and a Quarterly Report

In this project, we are given a list of data. It contains contains headers for a company division, category, and sales per month and well as the totals.

Lets bring what we completed in the last projects together. We have a set of raw data for the 4 divisions of the company and their sales reports for the first quarter. We want to prepare a quarterly report of all the sales data. 

We want to format the lists, sum the values and combine the worksheet data for each division into one long quarterly summary report.
