# Project #6 - Working with Excel VBA User Formulas

In this project, we are given a list of data. It contains contains headers for a company division, category, and sales per month and well as the totals.

We want to be able to create some User Forms as a way of interacting with a user. Well interact with them through things like buttons, which users can click. 

We will add in some previous procedures, for example the final report, and allow users to click a button and run this procedure.
