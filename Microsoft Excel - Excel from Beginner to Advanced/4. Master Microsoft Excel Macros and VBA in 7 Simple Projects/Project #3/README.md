# Project #3 - Preparing and Cleaning Up Data with Excel VBA

In this project, we are given multiple lists of data. We have multiple work sheets provided with just raw data. Each sheet represents the Sales Data for each Region.

We want to be able to Format these lists all at the same time. We can format the first list manually, then automatically format the similar lists in different worksheets. Also note, these worksheets do not need to have the same number of records. We want to make our procedures dynamic and adjust to how ever many records are provided in each sheet.

We will achieve this with the Help of Loops. It is useful to be able to loop between different worksheets and perform the procedure in each one.
