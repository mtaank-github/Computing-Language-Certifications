# Project #2 - Interacting with the User

In this project, we are given a list of data. It contains contains headers for a company division, category, and sales per month and well as the totals.

We want to be able to sort this data. We can sort it by the division, by the category or by the total sales. 

We want to be able to sort by any of these methods at the click of a button. In the data file, we write some code that will prompt the user and ask them how they would like to sort the data, by which of the three options would they like to sort the data. 

Using Logic statements, we can get Excel to sort the list for us depending on the value provided by the user.
