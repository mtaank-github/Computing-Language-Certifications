# Microsoft Excel 103 - Advanced Level

In this part of the course, we mainly look at the more advanced functions and areas of Excel and its interfac through Macros and VBA.

This part of the course is more "Do-it-yourself". In place of lectures, there are projects where I am doing the work myself. These projects will help to learn about using Macros and Visual Basic Code to make Microsoft Excel easier to use and get rid of repetitive tasks. 

Why should I do the work when Excel can do it for me.

I will be sharing my Excel project files as well some notes that go along with them in the subdirectories.
