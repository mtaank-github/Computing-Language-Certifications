Section 4 Notes:

Working with functions

Lecture 20: The structure of an Excel function
-Most common function is the "sum function". Type "=sum()" to use this. 
-3 parts to a function:
   -All start with the equal sign
   -followed by the equal sign is the function name
   -finally is the arguments of the function in parentheses.
   -for example: "=sum(B4:B9)".
-Note: to say we want the range of B4 to B8, we use the colon to denote "from B4 to B8"
-Function arguments window. In the formula bar, when you type your function, you can click the "fx" symbol and you will open this window.
-lots of functions: there are 461 built in functions. Microsoft add/remove functions all the time.
-in the formulas tab, there is a "Function Library" where you can see lots of functions.

Lecture 21: Working with the SUM() function
-we only have 5 items to sum, but what if we had 100, 1000, more. We want to use functions to make this easier.
-go to formulas tab, go to "math and trig" tab, then youll see a bunch of math functions. It automatically selects the data for you.

Lecture 22: Working with the MIN() and MAX() Functions
-Made a new row (#11) with labels for min and max.
-Similar to the sum function. Select a range of cells. But now, instead of summing up the values in that range, it tells you the minimum value in this range of values.
-Notice in "Math and Trig", there is no min and max function. Look in "More Functions" then "Statistical". You will find it there.
-You may have to adjust the entry in "Number 1" in the formula when you use the function from the formula bar.
-MAX() function is identical but now returns the maximum value of a range of numeric values.

Lecture 23: Working with the Average Function
-Note using regular math, we want to sum a set of values, then divide by the number of values: example (1000+125+150+300+100)/5. Too much math if there is more data.
-Can go to formulas tab, go to "More Functions" then "Statistical" to find the average function.
-Could just type "=average()", or short form type "=avg()".

Lecture 24: Working with the COUNT() function
-Make new column called count. This tells you a count of how many bills youve payed in the spreadsheet.
-Note: Count function only counts numeric values.
-Notice if we did not pay rent for one month, delete it from the spreadsheet, the count will update itself due to the reference.

Lecture 25: Adjacent Cells Error in Excel Calculations
-Notice that some of the cells where we used these functions have a green triangle in the top corner of each cell. If you hover these, there is a symbol that looks like something is wrong.
-Excel doesnt know that these numbers are bills or dates or etc. It just knows these are numbers. It sees the date and thinks "Thats a number too" and so it thinks we should put that into the formula. 
-We can select all these cells, hover to the diamond error symbol and click "Ignore Error".
-Sometimes it does identify real errors but adjacent cells error is not an error so click ignore.

Lecture 26: Using the AUTOSUM() Command
-Want to streamline these operations even more using shortcuts. 
-We saw the math approach, and the sum function approach. Now lets see autosum.
-In the formulas tab in the ribbon, there is a big sum symbol and says AutoSum.
-Click in the cell you want to calculate the sum, then click the autosum button. It does it automatically.
-Sometimes, Excel tries to assume too much. Notice it doesnt always work due to its defaults.
-In the case it didnt work (cell E6), you just have to grab the correct data.
-Notice the autosum button in the formula bar has an arrow drop down menu. It has the min max count and average functions there.

Lecture 27: Excel's AutoSum Shortcut Key
-Keyboard shortcut. Click "ALT+=" and it will autosum for you.
-If you hover the AutoSum button in the ribbon, it also tells you this shortcut.

Lecture 28: Using the AutoFill Command to Copy Formulas
-Notice that when we calculated the totals, we are using the exact same formula. We are summing the above 5 cells. This is repeated for jan,feb,march. We have to be able to automate this. This is where AutoFill comes in.
-Want to move the formula to other cells. I.e., move formula from B9 to C9 and D9.
-AutoFill feature is the little green box in the bottom right corner of the selected cell. 
-To copy the formula to other cells hover the little box in the corner and hold it and drag to the other cells to autofill the other cells.
-This can also work with absolute references. For the percent tab, we want to autofill this. So we type "=E4/$E$9". When we drag the autofill, notice that the denominator doesnt change in any of the cells due to the absolute reference. But the E4 does get updated.
