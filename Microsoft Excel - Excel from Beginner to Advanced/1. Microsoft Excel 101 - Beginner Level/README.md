# Microsoft Excel 101 - Beginner Level

In this part of the course, we mainly looked at the fundamentals of Excel and its interface. 

We started from scratch with a "**Monthly Budget**" spreadsheet. We created a monthly budget for ourselves by inputting our own data into the spreadsheet, then lecture by lecture, we updated the spreadsheet.

We learned the following skills:
  - Editing Text Formulas
  - Cell referencing
  - Basic Excel Functions
  - Modifying a worksheet
  - Formatting a worksheet
  - Inserting images and creating charts
  - Printing worksheets
  - Excel Templates
  
Going through the lectures, some of the main skills I picked up included:
  - Entering and Editing Text and Formulas
  - Working with Basic Excel Functions including: **SUM()**, **MIN()/MAX()**, **AVERAGE()**, **COUNT()**, and AutoSum.
  - Modifying and Formatting an Excel Worksheet
  - Creating Charts and Generating SmartArt
  - Printing Excel Worksheets
  - Creating Excel Templates

This part of the course really covered the most basic areas of Excel. It was beneficial to be able to do the work myself on my own spreadsheet to get some working experience of the Excel interface.

In the next part of the course (102), we start looking at more intermediate level content.
