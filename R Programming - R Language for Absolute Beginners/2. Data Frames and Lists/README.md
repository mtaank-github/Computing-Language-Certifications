# Data Frames and Lists

In this section we start looking at one of the most important things in Data Science: Data Frames and Lists.

We start with an introduction to data frames, looking at what they are, how they look and how to generate one in R. Same thing with Data Lists. 

We will come back to the topic of Data Frames a little later when we look at a real data set.
