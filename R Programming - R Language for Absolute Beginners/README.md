This directory with highlight my work from the R course from Udemy. This course is constantly updated, and was completed by me in March 2023 using the latest versions of R and RStudio.

This course is a no-experience-required Introductory course. I am going into this with very limited knowledge of the language, so this will be a great opportunity to really learn just how powerful this language really is.
 
I have created subdirectories for certain sections of the course. In these subdirectories, I share my lecture notes from following along the video lectures and supply my codes wherein I use what was learned in lecture in a practical setting and actually write the code myself.
