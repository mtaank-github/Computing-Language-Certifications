# Vectors, Arrays and Matrices

In this section we start looking at the Numerical side of R.

We start out by looking at the different datatypes in R, then move on to some basic functions in R. Finally we take a look at Vectors, Arrays, and Matrices. We focus on how to define these, how to perform calculations with these, etc.
